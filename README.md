A live demo of this repository is available on [Heroku](https://mymoneycounts3.herokuapp.com).

## Description

My Money Counts is a web application, utilising the MERN stack to build both the front-end and backend aspects of the application. The goal of this application is to aid persons with intellectual disabilities (PwIDs) in managing their money. This is achieved by providing users with rich graphics and data visualisations that will assist users with learning/mathematical difficulties or cognitive impairments in managing their finances. The vision for this project is to develop a fully responsive hybrid application that is sensitive to the userâ€™s needs.
